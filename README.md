# ThreeDeeTeaParty

A JavaScript '3D engine' that currently only displays a cube that you can rotate around using buttons, it uses orthogonal view because I'm still figuring out how to do perspective.

The name was one that ChatGPT suggested based on the code, I found it so funny that I want to share with you some of the other names that they suggested:

- MatrixMischief
- PolyGoneMad
- ZAxisZaniness

All of them could've been the official name, I love them.
